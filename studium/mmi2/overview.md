## HCI an the Web ##

### HCI – a Quick Reminder ###

* What is Usability?
* Why is it important?
* Basic HCI Models

### Web-Technology – a Brief Overview ###

*Mostly the technical representation of the web.*

* Distributed Filesystems as Basis
* Evolution of HTML (4 => 5)
* How does the Internet work: Architecture, Protocols (Client-Server)
* Usability Issues (technical reasons)
* What to look for while developing on the web (from the backend point of view)
* Evolution of the web
	* Media-Types 

### Web Usability: How Do We Use the Web? ###

*More the frontend way of things*

* Heterogeneous users as one of the reasons why usability is important
* Differences between the designed use and the actual use
* Steve Krug's **Don't Make Me Think** as reference

### Designing Web Sites for Usability ###

* Conventions in media consumption
* The Simplicity Principle
* Cross Platform Design 
	* Screen Resolution
	* Different Devices
	* Static vs. Fluid *Why no mention of responsive Webdesign?*
* Response Times
	* *should also mention rendering times*
* AJAX Applications
* Links
* URL Design
* Navigation
* Search
* Content Design
* Content Structures
	* Linear Structure
	* Linear w/ options
	* Linear w/ alternatives
	* Linear w/ side branches
	* Circular Structure
	* Information Grid (can contain multiple dimensions)
	* Hierarchy (Deep, Flat)
	* Pure web (... how it actually is)
	* Frames

### Web Accessibility ###


* Accessibility for users with disabilities
* Screen Reader
* WAI, Section 508, WCAG, BITV


## Introduction to Interactive Surfaces ##

### Intro & History ###

* since 1990s
* mostly with projectors form the user' side
* cameras used for analyzing 
* "Terioriality on tables"
* "Orientation on tables"
* "Fat Finger Problem"
* Occlusion Problem

### Hard- and Software for Interactive Surfaces ###

* Output: Displays
	* Front Projection
	* Back Projection
	* Projection from the side
	* Screens
* Input: Sensing
	* Touch Screens
		* Capacitive Sensing 
	* Optical Sensing (Infrared)
		* FTIR
		* DI
	* Optical Tracking from the side
* Examples and Software

### Interaction Techniques on Interactive Surfaces ###

* Single Touch
	* How to implement Actions?
* 2-Point Touch
	* Gestures
* > 2-Point Touch
* Shape-based interaction
	* Proxy-Objects

### Haptic Output on Interactive Surfaces ###

	Haptic: everything relating to the sense of touch, in particular relating to the perception and manipulation of objects using the senses of touch. (Oxford Dictionary, 2012)

#### Four Technical Approaches ####

**Actuating the screen' surface or encasing of device**

* Example: Vibrations
* Advantages:	simple feedback, simple implementation
* Disadvantages: reduced expressiveness, not scalable to larger devices, ambiguity (no differentiations)

**Actuating 'Tactile Pixels'**

* Example: Shape Displays (Display elevates or pretends to)
* Advantages: rich tactile stimuli, multi-tactile feedback
* Disadvantages: reduced tactile resolution, limited flexibility, complex technology, limited scalability

**Actuating additional devices**

* Example: Additional devices (pens, cubes, etc.)
* Advantages: rich tactile stimuli, several tactile modalities, freedom of design of interactive surface, scalability, new input modalities
* Disadvantages: occlusion, additional device needed, no direct manipulation, no gestural input, problems with multi-tactile feedback 

**Remote tactile feedback**

* Example: Actuators in the user's environment (wearable, embedded)
* Advantages: simplification of implementation, arbitrary form and size, direct touch, multi-haptics
* Disadvantages: constant contact with actuators, neural integration needs training, depend from body surface

**State Of Art**

* miniaturization of actuator
* progress in physiology
* continuing prevalence of touch interfaces

### Nonplanar Surfaces ###

* Examples: Curve, BendDesk

### Flexible and Deformable Surfaces ###
